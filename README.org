A stack based virtual machine in C11.  Deals primarily in bytes,
doesn't make assertions about typing and is very simple to target.
* Instructions to target
You need to link with the object files for
[[file:lib/base.c][base.c]], [[file:lib/darr.c][darr.c]] and
[[file:lib/inst.c][inst.c]] to be able to properly target the OVM.
The basic idea is to create instructions via ~inst_t~ then using the
~inst(s)_write_*~ API to generate bytecode (and write to a file).

Then to execute the program, the virtual machine interpreter ~ovm.out~
is used.

For clarity, one may build ~lib~ (~make lib~) then use the resulting
object files to link and create bytecode for the virtual machine.
