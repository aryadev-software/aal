A stack based virtual machine in C11.  Deals primarily in bytes,
doesn't make assertions about typing and is very simple to target.
* Instructions to target
You'll need [[file:src/inst.h][inst.h]] for the instruction API.  You
must convert user programs to instructions via ~inst_t~, then emit
bytecode via ~insts_write_bytecode*~.

This is all that is necessary to create a language which targets this
virtual machine.  To execute that bytecode, a user must use my virtual
machine program.
